A developer has provided you with broken code and an error message. Your task is to:

1. Explain WHY this error occurs (in the context of both development and production/testing)
2. Provide the FIXED code
3. Suggest a UNIT TEST that would catch this error before it reaches production

Format your response EXACTLY as follows:

[Clear explanation of the root cause and why it's problematic in testing/production]

## The Fix

\`\`\`
[The corrected code]
\`\`\`

## Prevention Test
